Original implementation was ~940 ms on 5m items
Adding the queue took it to ~810 ms
Both were single threaded

Now I want to do multithreaded, with one thread reading from the file and creating chunks of work
With one reader and one processor it goes to ~690 ms, but I'm way less confident it works

Switching to 100m to get a better idea, runs in 7.13 seconds as it stands
